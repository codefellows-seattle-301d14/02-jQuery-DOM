#### Single-line Summary
**Today, Ford and Jonny paired together. It took about 40 mins**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we started on adding all the scripts to the HTML
  2. Next, we filled out the articles constructor function.
  3. Third, we added jQuery to remove the 'template' class from the articles clone.
  4. Forth, we added jQuery to set the title, author, author url, and body text.
  5. Fifth, we fixed the jQuery for the published on date so that the attributed was set to 'datetime' instead of 'title'.
  6. Celebrated a completed lab!
